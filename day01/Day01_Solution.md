# 7 Days Terraweek Challenge: Day 1 - Getting Started with Terraform
Greetings Terraform enthusiastic, I have accepted Terraweek Challenge, So let's begin
## Day1: Introduction to Terraform and Terraform Basics
1. What is Terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code?
2. Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?
3. How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?
4. Explain the important terminologies of Terraform with the example at least (5 crucial terminologies).

Before diving into Terraform, it's essential to grasp the concept of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. So, let's rephrase your sentences and provide a brief explanation:
"Let's begin by understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC) before delving into Terraform."

Explanation:
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a methodology that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure resources, such as servers, networks, and databases, using code and automation tools. It allows you to define your infrastructure configurations as code, enabling easier management, version control, and reproducibility of your infrastructure environments. Terraform is one of the popular tools used for implementing IaC, helping you create, modify, and manage infrastructure resources through code-based configurations.

There are Various IaC tools like Terraform, Chef, Puppet and Ansible.
**"Read this blog to understand why Terraform is the preferred choice and the best option for infrastructure provisioning."**

## What Is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool for provisioning, managing, and deploying infrastructure resources. It is an open-source tool written in Golang and created by the HashiCorp company. With Terraform, you can manage infrastructure for your applications across multiple cloud providers - AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. - using a single tool.

To get started with Terraform, developers simply need to download the Terraform binary, choose which (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers) they'll be working with, create some (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration)

## How Infrastructure as Code works?
Without IaC, the team would individually configure the infrastructure (servers, databases, load balancers, containers, etc.) for each deployment. Over time, environments that were intended to be identical, become inconsistent (they are often called “snowflakes”), which makes them harder to configure and subsequently slows down deployments.
So, IaC uses software tools to automate administrative tasks by describing infrastructure in code.

It’s implemented like this:

The team writes infrastructure configurations in a required programming language.
The code files are sent to a code repository.
An IaC tool runs the code and performs the required activities.
